        <p class="pbad">In this game, you are sent on a mission to destroy criminal spaceships
        <br>and defeat the boss without losing your life. I implemented many HP 
        <br>variables and a point scoring system for my scoring systems. I used 
        <br>a randomizer to change the color of my return to home/try again buttons
        <br>which appear when the user loses or wins the game. The randomizer picks 
        <br>a number from 1 to 5 which changes the color value of the text. The game 
        <br>increases in difficulty as you defeat more spaceships, until you defeat 
        <br>the boss.The player loses when the avatar's HP goes from 30 (when the game 
        <br>starts) to 0. Each laser lowers the player's HP by 1.</p>

        <h3 class="chic">Reflection</h3>
        <p class="pbad">I made this game, because I wanted to remember some of my childhood days
        <br>with my father. When he would take my brother and I somewhere, he 
        <br>would let us play an arcade game like this on his phone. That game is
        <br>what inspired me to create Space Laser X. 2 succesful points in this 
        <br>project was being able to make my lasers destroy the player spaceship
        <br>and the enemy spaceship as well as making a functional pause menu. 2
        <br>obstacles I had were making new enemy ships appear once a certain 
        <br>amount of ships died and making the scrolling background. I overcame 
        <br>the dead ship problem by making a death toll variable and implementing
        <br>it into my code. I created a scrolling background by looking at 
        <br>speckosaurus's project on infinte scrolling backgrounds and basing my
        <br>code off of his project (Ms.Terry also helped!). If I had more time
        <br>or some subordinates helping me, I would fix the resume button, make 
        <br>the enemy spaceships more active (dodging lasers), add powerups, and 
        <br>make the boss more powerful (ex. spraying bombs throughout the map; 
        <br>buffing HP).
        <br>An algorithm that helped me a lot on this project was my moving
        <br>background algorithm. It is an algorithm, because it contains step-by-
        <br>step instructions. It works by making my background sprite start in 
        <br>the center of the page and move back 30 layers (so its behind all other
        <br>sprites). Then, it continuously moves speed(set at 1) steps until it 
        <br>goes of the right side of the map. When this happens, it teleports to
        <br>the left side of the map and continues moving until it is on the right
        <br>side again. Here is a screenshot of it:</p>

        <h2 id = "dep">Natan's Adventure to Varsity</h2>
        <p class = "pbad">I collaborated with David Pham to create this story on 
        <br>Python. In our story, Natan Tan is an unlucky 5'2 senior trying to get 
        <br>into varsity. The player must guide Natan on his adventure. There are
        <br>5 different endings to the story. Natan has 3 major options throughout
        <br>the story: training, challenging, and, later on, intelligence. Training
        <br>enables him to increase his skill, challenging progresses him closer
        <br>to varsity, and increasing his intelligence raises the effectiveness  
        <br>of his training. Natan also has an option to stay in varsity once he 
        <br>gets there, but he can continue and attempt to become the best player
        <br>in varsity. There is a secret boss that Natan can challenge if the 
        <br>player meets all the requirements once he beats the top varsity player.</p>

        </a>
        <p class = "pbad">While we were coding the story, David and I incremented
        <br>new challenges and endings. For example, in the beginning we thought the
        <br>story would end when Natan made varsity. However, we expanded it to allow  
        <br>him to be the best player in varsity. After our incrementation, we realized
        <br>that it was still possible to beat the best varsity player with a fair
        <br>amount of weeks to spare, so we added a secret boss challenge for lucky
        <br>players. When we were making the story, one element that gave us trouble 
        <br>was how to make the story go on after the first challenge is vanquished.
        <br>After many attempts, I solved this problem by adding a variable called 
        <br>"stopcodon" that adds 1 to its current value whenever a challengee is 
        <br>defeated. One iterative process was when we improved the story by
        <br>increasing the range of options Natan has. We did this by allowing the 
        <br>user to choose to increase Natan's intelligence('i') after he defeats his 
        <br>second challenge. We then added the intelligence variable to the amount
        <br>of skill gained from his training so it will increase the range of his 
        <br>training. We used a random number generator for his training, and his
        <br>intelligence increases the minimum and maximum value of his training.</p>
        <p class = "pbad">Organizing scenes into functions is a form of procedural 
        <br>abstraction, because we can call on the function with one line instead
        <br>of having to rewrite the whole code. For example, our function called 
        <br>training() was used many times throughout our program and we just need
        <br>to call on the function by typing training() to perform all the actions
        <br>listed in its definition. Thus, by shortening the code David and I 
        <br>made it more organized and easy to read, which exemplifies abstraction.</p>
        <p class = "pbad">Two stories I liked were Depresso Cat and Bank Heist. 
        <br>I liked Depresso Cat, because of its use of imagery and personification.
        <br>The cat was very descriptive when narrating its story and seemed similar
        <br>to a human. I also enjoyed Bank Heist, because there were surprising 
        <br>plot twists at the ends. In one ending, the narrator ends up ditching 
        <br>the heist, which suprised me since the narrator was involved in criminal
        <br>activity.</p>
