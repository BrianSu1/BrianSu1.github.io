        <p class="pbad">In this game, you are sent on a mission to destroy criminal spaceships
        <br>and defeat the boss without losing your life. I implemented many HP 
        <br>variables and a point scoring system for my scoring systems. I used 
        <br>a randomizer to change the color of my return to home/try again buttons
        <br>which appear when the user loses or wins the game. The randomizer picks 
        <br>a number from 1 to 5 which changes the color value of the text. The game 
        <br>increases in difficulty as you defeat more spaceships, until you defeat 
        <br>the boss.The player loses when the avatar's HP goes from 30 (when the game 
        <br>starts) to 0. Each laser lowers the player's HP by 1.</p>

        <p class="pbad">I made this game, because I wanted to remeber some of my childhood days
        <br>with my father. When he would take my brother and I somewhere, he 
        <br>would let us play an arcade game like this on his phone. That game is
        <br>what inspired me to create Space Laser X. 2 succesful points in this 
        <br>project was being able to make my lasers destroy the player spaceship
        <br>and the enemy spaceship as well as making a functional pause menu. 2
        <br>obstacles I had were making new enemy ships appear once a certain 
        <br>amount of ships died and making the scrolling background. I overcame 
        <br>the dead ship problem by making a death toll variable and implementing
        <br>it into my code. I created a scrolling background by looking at 
        <br>speckosaurus's project on infinte scrolling backgrounds and basing my
        <br>code off of his project (Ms.Terry also helped!). If I had more time
        <br>or some subordinates helping me, I would fix the resume button, make 
        <br>the enemy spaceships more active (dodging lasers), add powerups, and 
        <br>make the boss more powerful (ex. spraying bombs throughout the map; 
        <br>buffing HP).
        <br>An algorithm that helped me a lot on this project was my moving
        <br>background algorithm. It is an algorithm, because it contains step-by-
        <br>step instructions. It works by making my background sprite start in 
        <br>the center of the page and move back 30 layers (so its behind all other
        <br>sprites). Then, it continuously moves speed(set at 1) steps until it 
        <br>goes of the right side of the map. When this happens, it teleports to
        <br>the left side of the map and continues moving until it is on the right
        <br>side again. Here is a screenshot of it:</p>
